TO FIX:
1. account for transmission delay as buffer sends packet
2. (i think this is fixed but just putting it here for reference/affirmation)
  check the buffer when:
	- packet is sent: we want to take it off the buffer
	- buffer just finished processing another packet: check to see if another in buffer
	- packet is received: for half-duplex, when the other side needs to send a packet.
		- put ACK into the buffer
		- check the buffer at that point

3. The event 'Packet received at B at time tâ€™ means that *all* bits have been received at time t.

NEXT STEP: 
   1. implement static routing
	- hardcoded routing table
   2. put in metrics for plotting
