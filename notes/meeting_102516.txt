Meeting notes (10/25/16):
==============================
- Questions to ask:
    - Global queue
    - Flows - how do they work, seriously
        - Are flows breaking up the packets? What is the relationship of that to the host?
    - What is a queue event?
    - What is continuous interval? What are the differences?
    - How would acknowledgements work?

- Discrete event:
    - Event examples:
        - Send A -> B
        - Router receives packet
        - B receives packet
        - Send ACK to A
    - Global queue processes event one at a time
    - Events have start time
    - Looks at method in class and generates an event
    - Create event class

- Continuous:
    - Consider events all at the same time

- Packet class:
    - Parameters:
        - Origin
        - Destination
        - Size
        - Type

    - Methods:
        - On send
        - On receive

- Flow:
    - Example: sending packets A -> B and A -> C is two flows
    - Either the host class or the flow class can do the packet generation, congestion control, etc.

- ACKs:
    - Can have a parent class with ACKs as an inherited class

- Presentation:
    - Architecture
    - Work distribution
    - Plans for the future
